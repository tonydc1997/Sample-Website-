        The <a href="http://softcover.io" target="_blank">Softcover</a> publishing platform was designed mainly for ebooks like the <a href="http://railstutorial.org/book" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails Tutorial book</a> and <a href="http://learnenough.com/html" target="_blank"><em>Learn Enough HTML to Be Dangerous</em></a>, but it's also good for making traditional books, such as the novel <em>Moby-Dick</em> by Herman Melville (sometimes written as <em>Moby Dick</em>). We present below a short and affectionately irreverant book report on this classic of American literature.

          <em>Moby-Dick</em></a>
          by Herman Melville begins with these immortal words: 
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <span>Call me Ishmael.</span> Some years ago – never mind how long precisely – having litte or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
    </div>

    <p>
      After driving off his spleen (which <em>can't</em> be good for you), Ishmael then goes in on much the same vein for approximately one jillion pages. The only thing bigger than Moby Dick (who – <em>spoiler alert!</em> – is a giant whale) is the book itself.
